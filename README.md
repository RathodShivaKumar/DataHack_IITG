In this project, we aimed to predict the probability of respondents opting for the XYZ vaccine as well as the seasonal vaccine. We utilized logistic regression models for this purpose. Our process involved loading the datasets, cleaning the data by removing rows with missing target values, separating the target variables from the features, and dropping unnecessary columns. To handle missing values, we used the SimpleImputer, and for encoding categorical variables, we used the OneHotEncoder. Additionally, we standardized numerical features using the StandardScaler and combined the processed features into a single dataset. Following this, we trained logistic regression models on the preprocessed data and evaluated their performance using AUC-ROC scores. Finally, we generated predictions for the test set and saved the results to a CSV file for submission.
